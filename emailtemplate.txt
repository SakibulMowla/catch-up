Subject: Schedule Your Weekly Catch Up

Hello there,

Here’s your group for this week’s catchup:
{person_1_name}
{person_2_name}

(in case you’re looking for other person’s email address, it’s in the recipient list)

Please reach out to each other and find a time over the next 7 days that suits both of you and hangout on your favorite platform. If you’re unable to make it this week for any reason, please let the other person know about your unavailability.

The topic and length of the catch up is totally up to you to decide. While you can discuss life, universe and everything, here’s a handy list of things that you can pick from if you’re stuck - career, weather, current affairs, sports, politics and of course CSE SUST. A trip down memory lane is also always exciting!

If you want to unsubscribe to these emails, please send an email to {host_email_address} with “Unsubscribe” in the subject line.
